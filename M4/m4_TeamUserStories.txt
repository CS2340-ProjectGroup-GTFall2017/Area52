Eric (ID: emalavenda3):

   1) As a member of the NY City Council/Office of the Mayor of NYC, I want to monitor occurrences of areas having concentrated rat sightings, to prevent       complications with my voter constituency. I want to have access to data visualization tools, so that I can always keep a clear perspective regarding the       severity of the rat problem in New York City, and in any of its 5 boroughs.

   2) As a representative of the NYC Annex of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), I want to be able to monitor occurrences of infectious       disease, and specifically those commonly transmitted by rats. I am concerned with epidemiological data pertaining the spread of infectious disease most       often resulting from rat infestations, and to coordinate control activities with the EPA and other divisions of the CDC in New York City, as well as       educational events for residents of NYC. I also want to have access to data analytics & visualization tools, to more routinely & expeditiously obtain       updates regarding the status of the rat problem as it pertains to the spread of infectious disease in New York City, and in all of its 5 boroughs:       Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Staten Island.
